                            inclusive of intra- and extra-departmental cost modeling, business case
                            development, and implementation planning.</li>
                        <li>Oversaw a +140% increase in the Storage Engineering team and its successful
                            reorganization into two product (software/devops) and two functional (reliability)
                            engineering teams.</li>
                        <li>Doubled Spaces (S3) and Volumes (Block) and performance and climbed to
                            the second highest product growth rate at DigitalOcean.</li>
                        <li>Directed investments in consistency enforcement (Temporal), internal schedulers,
                            rebalancers, and other scale enhancements that achieved a further 80% reduction
                            in incidents per active accounts and a greater than 75% reduction in MTTR.</li>
                        <li>Pioneered the use of Kubernetes-on-metal (storage nodes) at DigitalOcean
                            as a means to reduce deployment and operations-related toil, enforce global
                            deployment consistency, and improve developer velocity.</li>
                        <li>Increased collaboration and influence with cross-functional partners resulting
                            in multiple cross-functional development projects, the production of self-service
                            APIs, and the successful transition of functions to more specialized operators.</li>
